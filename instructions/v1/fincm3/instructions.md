While not having the Fin board powered, connect your system to the board's DBG/PRG port via a micro-USB cable. Note for the Fin v1.1, only power the Fin from the PRG port for flashing.
Only for the Fin v1.0, power on the Fin by attaching power to either the Barrel or the Phoenix connector
Write the OS file you downloaded to the Internal storage. We recommend using <a href=\"http://www.etcher.io/\">Etcher</a>.
When flashing is complete, power off the board by detaching the power if connected, and unplug the DGB micro-USB cable

Connect your Balena Fin (CM3) to the internet. Power the Balena Fin (CM3) device up.
